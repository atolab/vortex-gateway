# opensplice-idl-plugin for Apache Maven

The **opensplice-idl-plugin** for Apache Maven drives the OpenSplice DDS'
*idlpp* command to process IDL files and generate corresponding code
(DDS types and typed DDS DataReaders and DataWriters).

By default (*i.e.* without additional configuration) this plugin
searches for files with an **.idl** extension in the `src/main/idl/`
directory, and generates Java code in the
`target/generated-sources/idl/` directory.

The generated Java files are automatically added to the list of Java
source files to be compiled by Maven during the "compile" phase.

In addition, the following optional parameters can be configured:
